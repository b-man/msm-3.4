Krait Voltage regulators

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,krait-regulator"
- reg:				Specifies the address and size for this regulator device
- qcom,headroom-voltage:	The minimum required voltage drop between the input
			 	voltage and the output voltage for the LDO to be
			 	operational, in microvolts
- qcom,retention-voltage:	The value for retention voltage in microvolts
- qcom,ldo-default-voltage:	The default value for LDO voltage in microvolts
- qcom,ldo-threshold-voltage:	The voltage value above which LDO is nonfunctional

Any property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example:
	krait0_vreg: regulator@f9088000 {
		compatible = "qcom,krait-regulator";
		regulator-name = "krait0";
		reg = <0xf9088000 0x1000>;
		regulator-min-microvolt = <500000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1100000>;
		qcom,headroom-voltage = <150000>;
		qcom,retention-voltage = <745000>;
		qcom,ldo-default-voltage = <745000>;
		qcom,ldo-threshold-voltage = <750000>;
	};
